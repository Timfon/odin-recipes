        </h3>
        <p>
            Often mistaken as a breakfast item due to the English designation "omelet," Khai Jiao is generally regarded by the Thai people as a rice topper to create a complete meal or a member of an all-out Sam Rap (family-style multi-dish feast) to complement a sour dish or take the edge off a chile relish.

            Here's what you need to make one serving: a couple of eggs, fish sauce to taste, a few droplets of acid (vinegar, lime juice, or lemon juice), and some vegetable oil. The only extra ingredient is optional but recommended: some rice flour (cornstarch works, too). You don't need much, a tablespoon will do. This helps the omelet form crisp edges. For those with rendered lard on hand, you can fry the omelet in that to get similar results. But if you're using plain vegetable oil, you may want to add a bit of flour to the beaten eggs.

            Making a good Thai-style omelet requires some technique, but it's nothing complicated.
